# AFGD-Exam: ”Space Art, or Something” - Generating 3D Voronoi Diagrams with a divide-and-conquer algorithm
This is the source code for a exam project for the course "Algorithms for Games Development" during the Spring 2021. On the games programme (tech track) at the IT university of Copenhagen

## The Project uses Unity Version 2020.2.2f1

A build version of the game made with the algorithm can be found at https://mojoe.itch.io/space-art-or-something

### Debugging and algorithm fun stuff
In the scene Sculpting, all the algorithm steps are combined in the gameobject "Run Algorithm" and it contains a script that includes some debugging features, like drawing the divide-and-conquer output or the generated graph.

The paper descriping the algorithms used, is locate in *INSERT PDF NAME*
