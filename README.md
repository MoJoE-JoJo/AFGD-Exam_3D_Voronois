# AFGD-Exam: ”Space Art, or Something” - Generating 3D Voronoi Diagrams with a divide-and-conquer algorithm
This is the source code for the exam project of the course "Algorithms for Games Development" on the games programme (tech track) at the IT university of Copenhagen, during Spring 2021.

## The Project uses Unity Version 2020.2.2f1
A build of the game made with the algorithm can be found at: https://mojoe.itch.io/space-art-or-something

### Debugging and algorithm fun stuff
In the scene Sculpting, all the algorithm steps are combined in the gameobject "Run Algorithm" and it contains a script that includes some debugging features, like drawing the divide-and-conquer output or the generated graph.

The paper descriping the algorithms used, can be found in the "3D Voronoi Diagram - Report" pdf file.
